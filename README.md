# Transformer
A transformer is a neural network architecture that converts an input sequence into an output sequence. It works by learning context and relationships between components of a sequence.
Transformers are a fundamental part of natural language processing and are used in many other machine learning and AI applications.
## Key features:
   **1.  Self-Attention Mechanism:** Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically.

   **2.  Positional Encoding:** Since the model does not process input in order, positional encodings are added to give the model a sense of word order.

   **3.  Scalability:** Easily scales with increased data and model size, making it suitable for large datasets.

   **4.  Parallelization:** Processes input data in parallel, significantly speeding up training times.

## Architecture:

The Transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure:

**•	Encoder:** Processes the input sequence and generates context-aware representations.

**•	Decoder:** Uses the encoder's output to produce the desired output sequence.

## Components:
**•	Multi-Head Attention:** Allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.

**•	Feed-Forward Neural Networks:** Applies a two-layer feed-forward network to each position independently.

**•	Layer Normalization:** Normalizes the output of each sub-layer, stabilizing training.

**•	Residual Connections:** Helps in training deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network without vanishing.

## Working:
Transformer models work by processing input data, which can be sequences of tokens or other structured data, through a series of layers that contain self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. The core idea behind how transformer models work can be broken down into several key steps.

**1.	Input embeddings:** The input sentence is first transformed into numerical representations called embeddings. These capture the semantic meaning of the tokens in the input sequence. For sequences of words, these embeddings can be learned during training or obtained from pre-trained word embeddings.

**2.	Positional encoding:** Positional encoding is typically introduced as a set of additional values or vectors that are added to the token embeddings before feeding them into the transformer model. These positional encodings have specific patterns that encode the position information.

**3.	Multi-head attention:** Self-attention operates in multiple "attention heads" to capture different types of relationships between tokens.

**4.	Softmax functions:** It is a type of activation function, are used to calculate attention weights in the self-attention mechanism.

**5.	Layer normalization and residual connections:** The model uses layer normalization and residual connections to stabilize and speed up training.

**6.	Feedforward neural networks:** The output of the self-attention layer is passed through feedforward layers. These networks apply non-linear transformations to the token representations, allowing the model to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.

**7.	Stacked layers:** Transformers typically consist of multiple layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer processes the output of the previous layer, gradually refining the representations. Stacking multiple layers enables the model to capture hierarchical and abstract features in the data.

**8.	Output layer:** In sequence-to-sequence tasks like neural machine translation, a separate decoder module can be added on top of the encoder to generate the output sequence.

**9.	Training:** Transformer models are trained using supervised learning, where they learn to minimize a loss function that quantifies the difference between the model's predictions and the ground truth for the given task. Training typically involves optimization techniques like Adam or stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

**10.	Inference:** After training, the model can be used for inference on new data. During inference, the input sequence is passed through the pre-trained model, and the model generates predictions or representations for the given task.

## Applications:
**1.	Natural language processing:** Transformers can translate text and speech, answer questions and summarize documents.

**2.	Large language models:** Transformers are a crucial part of large language models like ChatGPT, Google Search and Microsoft Copilot.

**3.	Drug design:** Transformers can help speed up drug design.

**4.	Finance and security:** Transformers can detect anomalies and prevent fraud.

**5.	Protein sequence analysis:** Transformations can analyse protein sequences.
